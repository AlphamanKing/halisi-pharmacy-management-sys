I want to come up with a welcome page to my online pharmacy web app. It should have visually appealing animation, and three options, these options can be in form of 'cards', animations etc. When clicked, each of these options take one to the respective module e.g pharmacist, customer and admin. Can you help? There can also be background images or one image, whichever you see best. I just want this welcome page to be visually appealing and welcoming
